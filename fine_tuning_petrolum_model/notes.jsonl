{"note": "Almost all-previous slug flow studies assume a constant slug length once a slug is formed and developed into a stable slug. In reality, a slug can grow or shrink as it travels through a pipeline as a consequence of the hilly terrain configuration."}
{"note": "The model described herein focuses on gas transmission with low-liquid loading conditions (hl/d < 0.3). Results show the model is capable of predicting the hydrodynamic behavior as well as the compositional profiles of gas and water flowing in a pipe."}
{"note": "Decommissioning activities in the North Sea alone are forecasted to require 2,624 wells to be plugged and abandoned during the 10-year period starting from 2019 (Oil&Gas_UK 2019)."}
{"note": "This model has allowed us to study the dynamics of displacement processes."}
{"note": "However, the wellbore-temperature measurements made at locations above the producing horizon may not exhibit these semilog straight lines because they are strongly dependent upon distance above the producing horizon, geothermal gradient, and radial-heat losses from the wellbore fluid to the formation on the way to gauge."}
{"note": "Both models are general in that flows in offshore wells can be handled rigorously. Computational results show that preserving energy of paraffinic oil is feasible by circulating hot fluid in the annulus and/or using insulation, thereby keeping solids in solution."}
{"note": "Thus, the hydrate-reservoir temperature increases gradually along the wellbore radial direction. Hydrates will dissociate after the hydrate equilibrium temperature is reached; this may cause wellbore collapse or methane leak from the reservoir and result in disaster."}
{"note": "This method could be useful not only to calculate and predict the SPP, but also to evaluate with accuracy the annular pressure drop in order to obtain the maximum allowable pump rates without fracturing the formations."}
{"note": "This was further analyzed in simple cases of horizontal and vertical flows of CO2\u2010rich crude\u2010oil mixtures, under key temperature/pressure conditions. Finally, comparisons were performed between the holdup and pressure\u2010gradient results of those cases, obtained with different liquid/liquid\u2010 and gas/liquid\u2010modeling approaches of a hydrodynamic point model of a commercial simulator."}
{"note": "This results in a lack of understanding and poor prediction of gas kick behavior in the field. To bridge this gap, we use distributed fiber-optic sensors (DFOS) for real-time estimation of gas rise velocity, void fraction, and influx length in water and oil-based mud (OBM) at the well scale."}
{"note": "Ideally, there are available data on both sides of each fracture so that the inverted width of each fracture can be obtained with a negligible error. In reality, the strain data are usually limited, providing less constraint on the width of individual fracture."}
{"note": "The range of B is quantified as from 1.54 to 2.5. In the slanted wellbore of gas wells, the critical liquid-loading gas-flow velocity is related to the angle \u03b2, the slant angle, and the width of the liquid droplet."}
{"note": "The focus of the investigation is to identify and estimate the size of surface defects on the basis of characteristic MFL signal features. It is demonstrated that this effort is greatly enhanced by finite-element analysis (FEA). The ultimate objective is to extract surface-flaw dimensions accurately from conventional MFL signals."}
{"note": "Monitoring of the inflow profiles in such wells is an important step in efficient reservoir management. Accurate temperature measurements [using distributed temperature sensors (DTSs), permanent downhole gauges (PDGs), or other forms of production logging] have become more widely available in recent years."}
{"note": "Wellbore and formation temperature distributions under different drilling-fluid-injection temperatures, flow rates, circulating times, and drilling depths are simulated by use of this model. Taking the hydrate-phase equilibrium into consideration, a possible region of hydrate-formation dissociation is analyzed, and effective methods are proposed to control the hydrate dissociation."}
{"note": "AI-Based Estimation of Hydraulic Fracturing Effect\n We studied the applicability of a gradient-boosting machine-learning (ML) algorithm for forecasting of oil and total liquid production after hydraulic fracturing (HF). A thorough raw data study with data preprocessing algorithms was provided."}
{"note": "Distributed fiber-optic sensing for in-well measurements is primarily used for monitoring purposes. Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is used to record acoustic disturbances and is sensitive to changes in strain, pressure, and temperature. Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) is used to measure temperature along the fiber."}
{"note": "Using the developed general simulation framework, we have discovered and studied several intriguing multiphysical phenomena that cannot be captured by commonly used reservoir simulators, including the temperature-decreasing phenomenon near the production well and the permeability-enhancement effect induced by the thermal unloading process."}
{"note": "When no carbon is produced to the surface, carbon capture requirements become significantly reduced, and their huge budgets are better used elsewhere. This paper discusses the viability of a wellbore natural gas gasification process, within a downhole completion tool, that converts methane wells into hydrogen (or H2) production wells."}
{"note": "In SAGD, steam injected into a horizontal injection well is forced into the reservoir, losing its latent heat when it comes into contact with cold bitumen at the edge of a depletion chamber."}
{"note": "Conduction is the main heat-transfer mechanism at the edge of the steam chamber in SAGD, and reservoir thermal conductivity is a key parameter in conductive-heat transfer. Conductive-heat transfer occurs at higher rates across reservoirs with higher thermal conductivity, which in turn affects the temperature profile ahead of the steam interface."}
{"note": "In addition, segmentation techniques are applied to high\u2010resolution ultrasonic image logs. These logs provide not only the image of the mega\u2010 and giga\u2010pore system but can also identify the permeable facies along the reservoir."}
{"note": "This study provides a theoretical basis for predicting the aggregation and deposition of hydrate particles in gas-dominated systems and a reference for the development of hydrate prevention and control plans. There is a critical need to balance economic prosperity, energy security, and environmental protection."}
