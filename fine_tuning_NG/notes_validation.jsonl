{"note": "The combination of these four proxies into a new MCV stack offers a credible reference for further assessing the dynamical interactions between orbital and millennial climate variability."}
{"note": "The current paradigm is that processing of dissolved organic matter converges to recalcitrant molecules (those that resist degradation) of low molecular mass and high molecular diversity through biotic and abiotic processes."}
{"note": "Hence, the onset of Quaternary glaciations, 2.6 million years ago, did not necessarily induce a synchronous global denudation pulse. Archaean seafloors shallowed with age due to radiogenic heating in the mantle\n\nGiven the scarcity of geological data, knowledge of Earth\u2019s landscape during the Archaean eon is limited."}
{"note": "Protracted timescales of lower crustal growth at the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise\n\nThe formation of oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges is a fundamental component of plate tectonics. A large fraction of the new crust is created when magmas in the lower crust cool to form gabbroic rocks."}
{"note": "Here we present the 207Pb\u2013206Pb isotope systematics in a calcium\u2013aluminium-rich inclusion from the Northwest Africa 2364 CV-group chondritic meteorite, which indicate that the inclusion formed 4,568.2\u2009million years ago."}
{"note": "Early martian mantle overturn inferred from isotopic composition of nakhlite meteorites\n\nThe early stages of planetary differentiation are characterized by the formation of magma oceans, which crystallize from the base up."}
{"note": "Increasing atmospheric helium due to fossil fuel exploitation\n\nFossil fuels contain small amounts of helium, which are co-released into the atmosphere together with carbon dioxide. However, a clear build-up of helium in the atmosphere has not previously been detected."}
{"note": "Here we use Dawn Framing Camera observations to analyse lobate morphologies on Ceres\u2019 surface and we infer the presence of ice in the upper few kilometres of Ceres."}
{"note": "Our proposed framework is particularly applicable to the late Ediacaran \u2018Shuram\u2019 isotope excursion that directly preceded the emergence of energetic metazoan metabolisms during the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian transition. Here we show that non-steady-state sulfate dynamics contributed to climate change, episodic ocean oxygenation and opportunistic radiations of aerobic life during the Neoproterozoic era."}
{"note": "The metal concentrations greatly exceed the maximum solubility of gold in the reservoir under saturated conditions and are now nearly two orders of magnitude higher than in mid-ocean ridge black smoker fluids\u2014the direct analogues of Reykjanes deep liquids."}
{"note": "Decreasing emissions of NOx relative to CO2 in East Asia inferred from satellite observations\n\nAt present, global CO2\u00a0emission inventories are mainly based on bottom-up estimates that rely, for example, on reported fossil fuel consumptions and fuel types."}
{"note": "We find that at terrestrial sites in the Northern Hemisphere, Hg() co-varies with CO2, which is known to exhibit a minimum in summer when CO2 is assimilated by vegetation."}
{"note": "About 16\u2009million years ago, a section of young slab that had broken off from a subducted spreading centre in the mantle first penetrated the 660\u2009km discontinuity beneath Oregon and Idaho, and pulled down older stagnant slab. Slab tearing occurred along pre-existing fracture zones and propagated northeastward."}
{"note": "Consequently, constraining volcanic hazards requires observations directly linking magma residence timescales to the thermal state and crystallinity of storage."}
{"note": "Our findings imply that the outlet glaciers of Greenland, and the ice sheet as a whole, are probably more vulnerable to ocean thermal forcing and peripheral thinning than inferred previously from existing numerical ice-sheet\u00a0models."}
{"note": "They develop by repeated frost cracking and ice vein growth over hundreds to thousands of years. Ice-wedge formation causes the archetypal polygonal patterns seen in tundra across the Arctic landscape."}
{"note": "Here we present experiments that demonstrate that under the conditions of planetary core formation expected for the Moon, Mars and Vesta, iron isotopes fractionate between metal and silicate due to the presence of nickel, and enrich the bodies\u2019 mantles in isotopically light iron."}
{"note": "The resulting abrupt greening of the Central Asian steppe-desert would have enabled mammal dispersal and could have played a role in carbon cycle feedbacks by enhancing soil organic carbon burial and silicate weathering."}
{"note": "Secular change in Archaean crust formation recorded in Western Australia\n\nThe formation mechanisms for early Archaean continental crust are controversial. Continental crust may have accumulated via horizontal accretion in modern-style subduction zones or via vertical accretion above upper mantle upwelling zones."}
{"note": "Here we present in situ X-ray diffraction measurements of two kinds of plagioclase feldspar in conditions of increasing pressures and temperatures. We find that the amorphization pressure of plagioclase decreases with increasing temperature, suggesting that previous studies overestimated this parameter."}
{"note": "Although observations of such events are now widespread, the physical conditions promoting shallow slow-slip events remain poorly understood. Here we use full waveform inversion of controlled-source seismic data from the central Hikurangi (New Zealand) subduction margin to constrain the physical conditions in a region hosting slow slip."}
{"note": "Instead, the experimental mud flows propagate like terrestrial pahoehoe lava flows, with liquid mud spilling from ruptures in the frozen crust, and then refreezing to form a new flow lobe."}
{"note": "Here we present thermodynamic calculations that establish the speciation of nitrogen in aqueous fluids under upper mantle conditions. We find that, under the relatively oxidized conditions of Earth's mantle wedges at convergent plate margins, nitrogen is expected to exist predominantly as N in fluids and, therefore, be degassed easily."}
{"note": "The lateral extent of volcanic interactions during unrest and eruption\n\nVolcanic eruptions often occur simultaneously or tap multiple magma reservoirs. Such lateral interactions between magmatic systems are attributed to stress changes or hydraulic connections but the precise conditions under which coupled eruptions occur have yet to be quantified."}
{"note": "The organic matter created supports oceanic food webs, including fisheries, and is an essential control on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Marine primary productivity is sensitive to changes due to climate forcing, but observing the response at the global scale remains a major challenge."}
{"note": "On the other hand, to maintain large variations in its thickness, Pluto\u2019s ice shell needs to be cold."}
{"note": "Here we turn to satellite observations of rainfall for the past 30 years. We detect significant covariability between tropical mean sea surface temperatures and the convective threshold on interannual and longer timescales."}
{"note": "We estimate that carbon sequestration due to nitrogen deposition has reduced current carbon dioxide radiative forcing by 96\u00b114\u2009mW\u2009m\u22122. However, this effect has been offset by the increase in radiative forcing resulting from nitrous oxide emissions, which amounts to 125\u00b120\u2009mW\u2009m\u22122."}
{"note": "Abrupt changes in the southern extent of North\u00a0Atlantic Deep Water during Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events\n\nThe glacial climate system transitioned rapidly between cold (stadial) and warm (interstadial) conditions in the Northern Hemisphere."}
{"note": "The warming has occurred in progressive phases since about AD\u00a01460, but intensification of melt is nonlinear, and has largely occurred since the mid-twentieth century. Summer melting is now at a level that is unprecedented over the past 1,000 years."}
{"note": "Here we use a simple, physically based model to demonstrate that, at atmospheric pressures lower than 0.1\u2009bar, transparency to thermal radiation allows short-wave heating to dominate, creating a stratosphere. At higher pressures, atmospheres become opaque to thermal radiation, causing temperatures to increase with depth and convection to ensue."}
